# mpvRex

**mpvRex is a fork of [mpvEx](https://github.com/marlboro-advance/mpvEx), which is based on [mpv-android](https://github.com/mpv-android/mpv-android). It aims to combine the powerful features of mpv with an easy to use interface and additional features.**

## Extra Features

- **Subtitle Seeking Gesture**: dedicated gesture action to seek to the next/previous subtitle line.
- **Primary Subtitle Indicator**: Visual indicator in the track menu showing the active primary subtitle.
- **Bottom Controls Layout**: Option to place playback controls below the seekbar implementation.
- **Accidental Tap Prevention**: Preference to ignore single taps on the seekbar to prevent accidental seeks.
- **Relative Seeking**: Drag on the seekbar seeks relative to the start position rather than absolute position.
